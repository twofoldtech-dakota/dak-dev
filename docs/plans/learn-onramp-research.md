# Learn on-ramp for non-technical readers — research & plan

> Status: MVP shipped (Decoder + one Demo, Decoded + Start Here index).
> Audience decision: **non-technical pros** (founders, PMs, designers, ops).
> Core gaps: **decode vocabulary** + **build accurate mental models**.
> Origin: people repeatedly ask, after a live agentic-engineering demo, "how do
> I learn / understand what you're doing?" This is the place to point them.

## 1. The question, scoped

"A Learn area to point non-devs/technical people/engineers to after a demo."
Clarified to:

- **Primary reader:** non-technical professionals who want to *understand*, not
  build. No code assumed.
- **Two core gaps:** (1) the **jargon** (agent, agentic, context window, MCP,
  harness, RAG…), (2) the **mental models** (what the agent is actually doing,
  why it works, why it fails).
- **IA:** left open ("surprise me") → see the decision in §5.
- **Deliverable:** multiple *distinct* concept options + a recommendation.

The brand constraint is the design key: *"complex concepts explained without
dumbing down."* That matches the plain-language standard exactly — calibrate
complexity, don't remove it. So every analogy is **paired with** the precise
term, never a replacement.

## 2. Method

Five parallel research angles (pedagogy; real-world explainer exemplars; how AI
agents are explained to non-tech audiences; learn-hub formats/IA; analogies &
mental models), then a verification pass on the load-bearing facts. Full source
list in §8.

## 3. The six options

| # | Concept | Gap | Build | Differentiation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The Decoder** — plain-English glossary of *your* words | Vocabulary | Low | Medium |
| 2 | **How This Actually Works** — 6–8 mental-model explainers | Models | Med | Medium |
| 3 | **Demo, Decoded** — annotated replays of real demos | Both, in context | Med | **Very high** |
| 4 | **Explain Me This** — one concept at escalating depth | Both (tiering) | Low (layer) | Medium |
| 5 | **Start Here** — guided on-ramp + curated canon | Orientation | Low | Low |
| 6 | **The Playground** — interactive agent-loop explorable | Models | High | High (caveated) |

Condensed rationale (evidence in §8):

1. **The Decoder.** Thematic (not alphabetical) glossary; each term =
   analogy → precise definition → example → go deeper. Define-on-first-use is
   the usability-tested jargon standard. On-brand hook: the existing
   `TextDecode` scramble-reveal literally "decodes" each term.
2. **How This Actually Works.** A finite set of Explanation-quadrant pieces, one
   durable mental model each (agent loop; context window = working memory; the
   jagged frontier; model-vs-system; autonomy dial; why it makes things up).
   Present an analogy, name where it breaks, offer a second — comparing analogies
   ≈ 3× transfer (Gentner).
3. **Demo, Decoded.** Take the real demo and annotate every move in context.
   Worked examples are the highest-leverage tool for novices (Sweller); it is
   *unreplicable* (your actual work) → strongest differentiator. **Made the
   signature piece.**
4. **Explain Me This.** Depth tiers (Curious → Decision-maker → Builder), capped
   at 2–3 (NN/g). Serves the whole spread without separate tracks, and avoids
   the debunked "learning styles" trap (tier by depth, not modality).
5. **Start Here.** Orientation ramp with specific link labels (not a generic
   "Get Started"), a suggested path, and "permission to not know."
6. **The Playground.** Highest wow, weakest evidence-per-dollar: interactivity
   boosts engagement but **does not beat good text on comprehension** (n=454),
   at high build + a11y cost. Defer to a flagship.

## 4. Cross-cutting principles (apply to all)

- Pair every analogy with the precise term.
- Question-first headers ("How does an agent remember?" not "Memory").
- Name the misconception, then correct it (7 ready-made misconceptions).
- Lead with "why this matters to *you*."
- Don't build modality tracks; do offer depth tiers.
- A11y is the existing gate: toggletips not hover; reduced-motion; captions +
  transcripts for video; `<title>/<desc>` on SVG diagrams.
- Avoid junk stats (the "80% video recall" and "90% Feynman retention" claims
  are unsourced — discarded).
- Be honest about limits (the 2025 hype correction is real).

## 5. IA decision

**Not a fifth pillar.** The four pillars are expert guides for builders; a
non-technical layer as a peer erodes the boundary-statement legibility that
DESIGN.md §4 protects. Instead: a distinct **on-ramp layer in front of** the
pillars at `/learn/start`, which funnels the curious *into* them (harness is the
natural bridge term). It still ships the §4 conventions (boundary, client-safe
types, loader, routing invariant) to stay architecturally honest. See
`DESIGN.md` §4.1.

Recommended build order: **Start Here + Decoder → mental-model explainers →
Demo, Decoded → Explain Me This (layer) → Playground (later)**.

## 6. What shipped (this MVP)

- `lib/onramp-types.ts` — client-safe: `ONRAMP_BOUNDARY`, routing invariant, the
  12-term glossary data + clusters, demo metadata, helpers.
- `lib/onramp.ts` — server loader for demo MDX (re-exports the types module).
- `components/learn/Decoder.tsx` — client island; thematic glossary using
  `TextDecode` + `ScrollReveal`.
- `components/learn/Annotation.tsx` — presentational "decode this step" margin
  note for demos.
- `components/learn/sectionTheme.ts` — added the `amber` (chapter-5) section
  colour for the on-ramp identity.
- `app/learn/start/page.tsx` — Start Here index (boundary, who-it's-for, the
  path, two ways in, connects into pillars).
- `app/learn/start/decoder/page.tsx` — the Decoder page.
- `app/learn/start/demo/[slug]/page.tsx` — Demo, Decoded template (MDX +
  `Callout` + `Annotation` + `AgentLoopStepper`).
- `content/onramp/demos/fix-a-failing-test.mdx` — first annotated demo.
- `app/learn/page.tsx` — "New here?" CTA band linking to `/learn/start`.
- `DESIGN.md` §4.1 — documents the non-pillar on-ramp layer.

## 7. Follow-ups (not in this MVP)

- The mental-model explainers (Option 2) as real Explanation pages.
- Define-on-first-use **toggletips** site-wide that link into the Decoder (WCAG
  1.4.13 toggletip pattern — dismissible/hoverable/persistent, tap-safe).
- "Explain Me This" depth-tier toggle on the hardest concepts.
- More Demo, Decoded walkthroughs from real sessions; optional narrated video
  (needs a CSP edit in `next.config.ts` + captions/transcript).
- Optional: wire the on-ramp into `LearnSidebar`/`LearnMobileNav` (see §4.1
  caveat) and an OG image for `/learn/start`.
