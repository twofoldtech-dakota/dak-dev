## Description

The content strategist is the primary entry point for autonomous content creation. It accepts multiple ideas, validates them against SEO opportunities, and orchestrates the full workflow through specialized agents.

**Key Features:**
- Accepts multiple ideas for batch processing
- Dedupes against existing content
- Matches ideas to SEO gaps for maximum impact
- Coordinates research, writing, and editing agents
- Produces posts that score 80+ without manual intervention

| Section | `components/home/*.tsx`, `components/blog/*.tsx` | Headlines, CTAs |
| UI | `components/ui/*.tsx` | Button labels, card text |

**Validation Rules Applied:**
- Forbidden phrases (hedging, filler words, corporate jargon)
- Passive voice detection
- Sentence length analysis
- Frontmatter requirements (title, excerpt, tags, keywords)
- SEO keyword placement

## Integration Points

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.content/calendar/content-plan.json` | Pipeline tracking |
| `.content/seo/strategy.json` | Keywords, gaps, clusters |
| `.content/brand/guidelines.json` | Voice validation rules |

## Anti-AI-Slop Enforcement

This skill enforces quality at multiple points:

1. **Research Gate**: Writing cannot start without specific metrics
2. **Section Validation**: Brand voice checked during writing
3. **Final Validation**: Score must reach 80+ to complete
4. **Max Iterations**: 3 fix attempts before escalation
