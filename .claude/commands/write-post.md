# /write-post

Create a new blog post with brand voice enforcement and quality gates.

## Usage

```
/write-post <topic>                           # Interactive mode
/write-post <topic> --type tutorial           # Specify type
/write-post <topic> --from-calendar idea_001  # From calendar backlog
```

## Description

Creates a complete blog post that passes brand voice validation. Coordinates research gathering, template filling, and iterative refinement until the post scores 80+.

## Workflow

```
Topic → Research → Draft → Validate → Fix → Repeat until score ≥ 80 → Done
```

### Step 1: Gather Research

Before writing, collect:
- **Metrics**: Specific numbers (%, ms, KB, x improvement)
- **Code Examples**: Real, tested snippets
- **Facts**: Verified technical details
- **Sources**: Documentation links, benchmarks

**Anti-Slop Rule:** Writing cannot start without:
- Specific metrics (generic claims like "improves performance" are rejected)
- Identified tradeoffs or limitations for the approach
- "When NOT to use" boundaries defined

### Step 2: Determine Content Type

| Type | Template | Use When |
|------|----------|----------|
| `general` | post.mdx.template | Standard blog posts |
| `tutorial` | tutorial.mdx.template | Step-by-step guides with code |
| `project` | project.mdx.template | Project showcases with metrics |

### Step 3: Generate Frontmatter

```yaml
title: "{{Topic refined to 30-70 chars, primary keyword included}}"
date: "{{Today's date YYYY-MM-DD}}"
excerpt: "{{140-160 chars EXACTLY - action verb + learning + benefit}}"
slug: "{{url-friendly-slug}}"
tags: [{{2-5 relevant tags}}]
thumbnail: "/images/posts/{{slug}}/thumbnail.jpg"
hero: "/images/posts/{{slug}}/hero.jpg"
published: false
author: "Dakota Smith"
keywords: [{{3-7 SEO keywords from research}}]
```

### Step 4: Fill Template

Load template from `.content/templates/` and fill each section:

**Introduction:**
- Bottom line first: lead with the key insight or result
- Context: What problem we're solving
- Promise: What the reader will learn

**Body Sections (3+ H2 headings):**
- Each section has clear heading
- Concrete explanations with metrics
- Code examples where relevant
- Validation after each section
- Tradeoffs section where applicable:
  - What could go wrong
  - When NOT to use this approach
  - The complexity cost

**Conclusion:**
- Summary paragraph
- 3-5 bullet-point takeaways
- Optional call to action

### Step 5: Validate

Run full validation:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-validation.ts validate <slug>
```

**Quality Gates:**
- Overall score ≥ 80
- Zero forbidden phrases
- All metrics are specific
- Excerpt is 140-160 chars exactly
- Title is 30-70 chars
- Tradeoffs/limitations addressed
- Bottom line in opening paragraph

### Step 6: Iterate (if needed)

If score < 80:
1. Review specific issues
2. Rewrite affected sections
3. Re-validate
4. Max 3 iterations before asking user for input

### Step 7: Update Calendar

Update `.content/calendar/content-plan.json`:
- If from backlog: move idea to topics with status "review"
- If new: add to topics with status "review"

## Output

Creates file at: `/content/posts/{slug}.mdx`

```

## Agent Coordination

This skill delegates to:

1. **Researcher Agent** (if needed): Gathers metrics, examples, facts via WebSearch
2. **Writer Agent**: Generates content following templates and brand voice
3. **Editor Agent**: Fixes validation issues in iterations

## Anti-AI-Slop Enforcement

### Required Before Writing
- [ ] Specific metrics gathered (not "improves performance")
- [ ] Real code examples (not generic pseudo-code)
- [ ] Verified facts with sources

### Checked During Writing
- [ ] No forbidden phrases (31+ patterns)
- [ ] Active voice (≤20% passive)
- [ ] Short sentences (≤35 words each)

### Transparency Checks
- [ ] Tradeoffs/limitations stated for technical advice
- [ ] No oversimplification phrases ("seamlessly", "effortlessly", "perfect solution", "zero overhead", "no downsides")
- [ ] "When NOT to use" boundaries included
- [ ] Real metrics from real projects (not synthetic)

### Validated After Writing
- [ ] Score ≥ 80
- [ ] Title 30-70 chars
- [ ] Excerpt 140-160 chars exactly
- [ ] 3+ H2 headings
- [ ] Conclusion with takeaways
- [ ] Bottom line in opening paragraph
- [ ] Tradeoffs/limitations addressed

## Failure Handling

**If validation fails after 3 iterations:**

```
Write Post Incomplete
============================================================

Created draft: /content/posts/edge-caching-api-response-times.mdx

Score: 72/100 (requires 80)

--- Remaining Issues ---
  ⚠ Excerpt too short: 135 chars (need 140-160)
  ⚠ Primary keyword "edge caching" not in first paragraph

--- Manual Fixes Needed ---
The draft is saved. Please:
1. Review the issues above
2. Edit the file manually
3. Run: /review-post edge-caching-api-response-times
```
