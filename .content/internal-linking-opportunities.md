## General Linking Strategy

### Anchor Text Best Practices
- Use descriptive phrases (not "click here" or "this post")
- 3-5 words optimal length
- Include target post keywords naturally
- Make links contextually relevant

### Linking Principles
1. **Relevance**: Link only when genuinely helpful to reader understanding
2. **Flow**: Links should not interrupt reading flow
3. **Balance**: 2-4 internal links per 1000 words
4. **Diversity**: Link to different posts, not always the same one

### Content Types That Benefit Most
- Tutorial series (sequential linking)
- Related concepts (conceptual linking)
- Tool/project showcases (cross-reference implementations)
- Deep dives vs. overviews (hierarchy linking)
